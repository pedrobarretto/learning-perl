# Learning Perl Repository

Welcome to the Learning Perl repository! This repository contains code and exercises for those who are new to Perl and want to learn more about the language.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured by dividing the Perl code into individual files, named according to their content. Each file represents a specific topic or concept related to the Perl language.

Here is the breakdown of the files in this repository:

- `01_scalar.pl`: This file covers the basics of scalar variables in Perl.
- `02_scalar_types.pl`: This file covers the different types of scalar variables in Perl.

And so on for the remaining files in the repository.

## How to Use This Repository

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine and start exploring the files. Each file is designed to be self-contained, so you can focus on a particular topic or concept without needing to refer to other files.

Each file contains comments and code examples to help you understand the topic or concept covered in that file.
